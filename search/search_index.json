In a normal circumstance, you don't need to do this process. However, if you want to customize the react app in a way you needed, then you need to alter the react components by your own. In this case, knowing the build process is necessary in order to get your changes reflected in the site. Prerequisites It is required that you have the tool csso-cli installed globally. It is using to optimize the CSS file that would be generated in the build process. npm i -g csso-cli How can you build the app You can build the react app with the below command NODE_ENV=production npm run build What happens when we build the react application?

It uses JSON files to keep your translation keywords. All of your translation JSON files needs to be kept under src/reactapp/public/i18n directory. We already have provided en_US.json file for your reference there. How to add a new language translation support You need to put your translation file inside src/reactapp/public/i18n directory. The format of your file is [locale_code].json . For example, for a German store, it should be de_DE.json . This is all you need to do. How can we translate strings in the component? There is a helper function __() available, similar to the translation facility in Magento templates. You can find this helper function at src/reactapp/src/i18n/__.js . For an example, please see the PlaceOrder component. File: src/reactapp/src/components/PlaceOrder.jsx import React from 'react'; import { __ } from '../i18n'; function PlaceOrder() { return ( <div className=\"flex items-center justify-center h-24\"> <Button variant=\"warning\" big disable={!isValid} click={() => submitHandler(values)} > {__('Place Order')} </Button> </div> ); } export default PlaceOrder; see the import of the function __() and usage. It is that simple. Another job __() function does is, it accepts any number of parameters which will be replaced in the string at the right position. For example, if you want to print the string: My name is Julius Caesar . You can do this: const firstName = 'Julius'; const lastName = 'Caesar'; __('My name is {} {}', firstName, lastName); In the string {} part indicates it is the dynamic part and needs to be replaced with the other parameters passing to the __() . These parameters will be replaced in the {} part in the given order. How it works It all starts with the root element on which react app is acted on. In the hyva-module, the root DOM looks like below: File: src/view/frontend/templates/react-container.phtml <div id=\"react-checkout\" data-language=\"<?= $localeProvider->getLocaleCode() ?>\" data-static_file_path=\"<?= $block->getViewFileUrl('Hyva_Checkout/js') ?>\" > ... </div> As you can see there is the data attribute data-language which will represent the current store locale. For example, if you are viewing a UK store, then it will look like <div id=\"react-checkout\" data-language=\"en_GB\" data-static_file_path=\"https://example.com/static/version1619794305/frontend/Magento/luma/en_GB/Hyva_Checkout/js\" > so en_GB is the locale code here. In this case, we need to keep our translation json file at src/reactapp/public/i18n/en_GB.json . React app will fetch the correct tanslation json file based on this and load it. You also note that there is another data attirbute which is data-static_file_path . This is needed in order to load the translation json file as a static asset in a hyva-theme or in luma-theme.
